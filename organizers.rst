Organizer Guide
===============

One of the hard part in sustaining a meetup is organizing the events. Our
organizers are also juggling a full-time job, families, and other important
commitments. Personal situations can change, and organizers may step down.

By providing this resource, we hope to provide transparency of what's
involved in organizing Vancouver PyLadies meetups, as well as providing
learning resource and guidelines to our future organizers.


Organizing the Meetup
---------------------

Each of our organizers self-organize. Usually one person would take charge for
organizing one meetup, and the others will provide support. Take turns organizing!

1. Decide on the format

   We try to meet once a month, alternating the `format <formats>`_. If we've
   just done a code jam, it would be desirable that the next meetup be a talk night
   or a workshop.

2. Decide on host and co-host

   Have at least one host and a co-host to balance and spread the workload.

3. Find presenters, if doing talk night or workshop

   Sometimes the presenters come to us, sometimes we have to find and ask them to
   present. We now have several forms to make it easier for folks who has presentation
   ideas.

   - `Speaking at Vancouver PyLadies <https://goo.gl/forms/iMUNDPIOg8OxpYoz1>`_ form.

   - `Workshop at Vancouver PyLadies <https://goo.gl/forms/B2e6zr7KgJ0v2yDf1>`_ form.

4. Find a venue

   Once the format has been decided, it's time to find a venue that is suitable
   for the format of the meetup.  The `sponsor <sponsor>`_ page has more details
   of what's required of each format.

5. Schedule the meetup

   Create the event on meetup.com. Decide on how many RSVPs to accept (usually
   only half shows up). Check if the venue has specific instruction for getting
   in. If there's food sponsor, it might be a good idea to survey for people's
   dietary needs. In this case we should set expectation and be clear that
   we can't accommodate everything.

6. Announce the meetup

   Announce the meetup using @pyladiesvan twitter account, as well as sharing
   the event in #vancouver PyLadies Slack channel.

7. Order food, if we have food sponsor

   In the past, we've ordered from: Dominos, Uncle Fatih, Nuba, Banana Leaf,
   Bali Thai, and at one time, one box of Timbits.

   We don't always have food budget.

Working with the Venue
----------------------

We have a list of venues we've worked with. It would be best to start contacting
the venue one month in advance. Some venues also host meetups for other groups,
and they can't always be available for the date we want.

Sometimes we may need to reach out to new venues. The following email template
might be useful::

    Hello,

    My name is {{ name }}, and I am one of the organizers of Vancouver PyLadies
    meetup.

    We're looking for a space to host our {{ format }} for {{ date }}.
    Please let me know if this is something that {{ company }} can accommodate?
