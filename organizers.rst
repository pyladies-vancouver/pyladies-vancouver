Organizer Guide
===============

One of the hard part in sustaining a meetup is organizing the events. Our
organizers are also juggling a full-time job, families, and other important
commitments. Personal situations can change, and organizers may step down.

By providing this resource, we hope to provide transparency of what's
involved in organizing Vancouver PyLadies meetups, as well as providing
learning resource and guidelines to our future organizers.


Organizing the Meetup
---------------------

Each of our organizers self-organize. Usually one person would take charge for
organizing one meetup, and the others will provide support. Take turns organizing!

1. Decide on the format

   We try to meet once a month, alternating the `format <formats>`_. If we've
   just done a code jam, it would be desirable that the next meetup be a talk night
   or a workshop.

2. Decide on host and co-host

   Have at least one host and a co-host to balance and spread the workload.

3. Find presenters, if doing talk night or workshop

   Sometimes the presenters come to us, sometimes we have to find and ask them to
   present. We now have several forms to make it easier for folks who has presentation
   ideas.

   - `Speaking at Vancouver PyLadies <https://goo.gl/forms/iMUNDPIOg8OxpYoz1>`_ form.

   - `Workshop at Vancouver PyLadies <https://goo.gl/forms/B2e6zr7KgJ0v2yDf1>`_ form.

4. Find a venue

   Once the format has been decided, it's time to find a venue that is suitable
   for the format of the meetup.  The `sponsor <sponsor>`_ page has more details
   of what's required of each format.

5. Schedule the meetup

   Create the event on meetup.com. Decide on how many RSVPs to accept (usually
   only half shows up). Check if the venue has specific instruction for getting
   in. If there's food sponsor, it might be a good idea to survey for people's
   dietary needs. In this case we should set expectation and be clear that
   we can't accommodate everything.

6. Announce the meetup

   Announce the meetup using @pyladiesvan twitter account, as well as sharing
   the event in #vancouver PyLadies Slack channel. Try to annouce the meetup at
   least 2 weeks in advance.

7. Order food, if we have food sponsor

   In the past, we've ordered from: Dominos, Uncle Fatih, Nuba, Banana Leaf,
   Bali Thai, and at one time, one box of Timbits.

   We don't always have food budget.


Presenter Guideline
-------------------

Talks can be any length, from a 5 min lightning talk to a 30 min practice of a
conference presentation.

Talks should:

- [ ] Be related to the tech industry, preferably Python
- [ ] Not a pitch, marketing or recruitment tool
- [ ] Follow Code of Conduct

Ideas include but are not limited to:

- walkthrough of a problem you solved recently
- demo of a project you're working on
- summary of your favourite Python library
- guide to how you got to your current technical skill level (including beginner!)
- discussion of how software affects your field or anything

Ask about speaker preferences, such as:

- Are you taking any questions?
- Are you OK with people raising hands during the talk, or should they wait until the end?
- Do you have a Twitter account so we can credit you?
- Are you OK to be photographed?


Working with the Venue
----------------------

We have a list of venues we've worked with. It would be best to start contacting
the venue one month in advance. Some venues also host meetups for other groups,
and they can't always be available for the date we want.

Sometimes we may need to reach out to new venues. The following email template
might be useful::

    Hello,

    I'm {{ name }}, one of the organizers of Vancouver PyLadies meetup.

    We're looking for a space to host our {{ format }} for {{ date }}.
    Please let me know if this is something that {{ company }} can accommodate?

    PyLadies is an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women
    become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. Our
    mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community through
    outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings.

    Our meetup page is at: https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Vancouver/

    If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

    Regards,
    {{ name }}
    PyLadies Vancouver


If your first attempts don’t work, contact other tech companies in your town.
Post messages on job boards, tech conference websites, or on other tech Meetup
channels.

Vancouver Public Library also provide `free meeting rooms <http://www.vpl.ca/facilities/branch-meeting-rooms>`_
for non-profit organizations.

Some things to look for when choosing a venue:

- [ ] Wifi that allows more than HTTP (eg SSH, rsync, FTP etc)
- [ ] Washrooms
- [ ] Plates, glasses, cutlery for dinner
- [ ] Seating for up to 30
- [ ] Accessible (wheelchair etc)
- [ ] Near transit
- [ ] Doesn't need front door runner, can get in via unlocked door or buzzer (optional)
- For talk nights:
    - [ ] Projector
    - [ ] Mic (optional)
    - [ ] Podium (optional)
- For Code Jams:
    - [ ] Tables to sit at
    - [ ] Lots of power outlets
- [ ] Twitter handle (optional, so we can thank you on Twitter for sponsoring)


Food Sponsorship
----------------

For food sponsorship, we budget around $8/person for dinner. We usually have
15-30 people show up, and assume half of the RSVPs on Meetup will attend.

There are 3 options for handling food:

#. PyLadies organizer does the ordering and the sponsor reimburses
#. PyLadies organizer plans the order and the sponsor pays
#. Sponsor handles ordering and payment

When ordering food, remember to include the following options:

- Meat
- Vegetarian
- Gluten free, if possible
- Dairy free, if possible
- Vegan, if possible

We also like to get sponsor's Twitter handle so we can thank them online!

Sometimes we may need to reach out to potential food sponsors, especially if the
hosting venue can't cover food. The following email template might be useful::

    Hello,

    I'm {{ name }}, one of the organizers of Vancouver PyLadies meetup.

    We're looking for a company to sponsor dinner for our {{ format }}. We usually
    budget around $100-$250. We'd thank {{ company }} on our meetup page and during the
    event for their support. Is this something {{ company }} is interested in doing?
