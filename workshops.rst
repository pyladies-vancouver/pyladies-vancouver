A list of past PyLadies Vancouver workshops.

We are always looking for speakers! Please fill in this `form <https://goo.gl/forms/B2e6zr7KgJ0v2yDf1>`_
and we'll get back to you!

Hands-on Intro to aiohttp
-------------------------

When: April 26, 2018

Lead by: Mariatta

Resource: https://us-pycon-2019-tutorial.readthedocs.io/

Skill level: Intermediate

Asyncio is a relatively new feature in Python, with the async and await syntax
only recently became proper keywords in Python 3.7. Asyncio allows you to write
asynchronous programs in Python. In this tutorial, we’ll introduce you to an
asyncio web library called aiohttp.

aiohttp is a library for building web client and server using Python and asyncio.
We’ll introduce you to several key features of aiohttp; including routing, session
handling, templating, using middlewares, connecting to database, and making HTTP
GET/POST requests. We’ll provide best practises in building your aiohttp application,
as well as how to write tests for your application.

We’ll use all new Python 3.7 features to build web services with asyncio and aiohttp.

Skill level: Intermediate
This tutorial assumes some experience programming with Python, REST APIs, git,
GitHub, and installing Python packages using pip.

Bring your own laptop, with your favorite IDE, text editor, and Python 3.7
pre-installed.

Intro to Data Analysis in Python
--------------------------------

When: July 7, 2018

Lead by: Jennnifer Walker

Resource: https://jenfly.github.io/pydata-intro-workshop/

Skill level: Beginner Level.

A little bit of previous experience with Python
or another coding language would be helpful, but not required!

In this workshop, you will develop skills with powerful data analysis tools
from Python's rich ecosystem of libraries. If you're wrestling with spreadsheets
on a regular basis and want to find better ways to analyze and visualize your
data, handle messy and missing data, and automate repetitive tasks, this workshop
is for you. If you're coming from another data analysis environment
(R, Matlab, etc.) and/or you're a Python enthusiast who is curious about Python's
data analysis capabilities, this workshop is also for you!

Working with real-world data and the Pandas library, you'll learn how to load
data from a comma-separated values (csv) file, quickly summarize it from many
different angles, and visualize it in graphs—all with just a few lines of code.
You'll also learn how to dive into the data for a deeper analysis with techniques
such as subsets, filters, text processing, and aggregation.

You'll want to bring your laptop for lots of hands-on practice as we work through
the lessons and exercises. We'll be using Python 3.6, Jupyter Lab, ``numpy``,
``pandas``, ``matplotlib``, and ``seaborn``. I highly recommend using Anaconda
to set up your environment, especially if you're new to Python and/or data
analysis is your main reason for using Python.

Build-a-GitHub-Bot Workshop
---------------------------

When: May 5, 2018

Lead by: Mariatta

Resource: https://github-bot-tutorial.readthedocs.io

Skill level: Intermediate

This workshop assumes some experience programming with Python, REST APIs,
git, GitHub, and installing Python packages using pip.

GitHub provides a great platform for collaborating. You can take it to the next
level by creating custom GitHub bots. By delegating some of the chores to a bot,
you get to spend more time developing your project and collaborating with others.

Learn how to automate your workflow by building a personal GitHub assistant for
your own project. We'll be using Python 3.6, ``gidgethub``, and ``aiohttp`` libraries.

Face Detection with Python and OpenCV
-------------------------------------

When: January 5, 2018

Lead by: Kiri Nichols

Resource: https://github.com/pyladies-vancouver/facetrack

Ever wanted to learn to do face detection with Python? This tutorial will cover
how to use the OpenCV package to work with images and video. Whether you're a
complete beginner or a total Python fiend, this tutorial is for you!


Python Packaging Workshop
-------------------------

When: October 25, 2017

Lead by: Brett Cannon

Resource: https://snarky.ca/a-tutorial-on-python-package-building

``pip install your-own-library``


In this workshop, we will learn all about Python packaging: what is it for, what
are the formats, what tools are available, and what the future holds. We'll go
through the process of publishing a package using flit. Bring your own laptop to follow along.

All skill levels welcome!

Intermediate Git Tutorial
-------------------------

When: November 17, 2016

Lead by: Holly Becker

Used git, but only a little? Want to know more about collaborating with other
people? Come to our git tutorial!

This will be an intermediate level git tutorial. It assumes you know how to do
the basics, like create a repository, add and commit files, and what a branch
might be useful for. If you've used git for your own projects but haven't used
it when collaborating with other people, this is for you! If you're brand new
to git, we'll be reviewing the basics at the beginning. If you're a git expert,
feel free to come and share you expertise!

Topics we're hoping to cover:

• Branches

• Merging & Rebasing (and why you might pick one over the other)

• Git visualizers

Art with Python and Facial Recognition
--------------------------------------

When: April 9, 2016

Lead by: Kiri Nichols

This painting from Doctor Who has the nifty property of being able to adjust
he perspective according to the position of viewers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUIbq2HPyQA

Cool, eh? Let's try to do this with Python! Starter code is on github:
https://github.com/small-yellow-duck/timelordart

With the magic of face detection in openCV, we can use a camera to track
the position of viewers.

https://realpython.com/blog/python/face-detection-in-python-using-a-webcam/

There are several python libraries for rendering 3d objects. Let's try a
few of them out!

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Vapory/0.1.0

http://www.pythonocc.org/quick-examples/hello-dumb-box/

Some problems you might wish to consider:

- how long does it take to render an image?

- what should happen if the face recognition algorithm doesn't find a face in the frame?

- what should happen if the face recognition algorithm finds more than one face in the frame?

Intro to Testing and Test Automation in Python
----------------------------------------------

When: February 2, 2016

Lead by: Christie Wilson

Resource: https://github.com/keeppythonweird/catinabox#catinabox

This is a repeat of the testing tutorial we presented in October. We've made
a few tweaks to the format, with more focus on pytest and less on system testing.

Please bring a laptop if you can. When we're closer to the date we'll give you
more info on the requirements (still trying to iron out the setup portion of the tutorial!), but for now:

* Create a github account if you don't have one already

* Setup your github SSH key

* Install python 2 or 3 with pip and virtualenv

* Install git

* Have a text editor or IDE
