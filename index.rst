Welcome to PyLadies Vancouver!
==============================


PyLadies is an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women
become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. Our
mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community through
outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings.

At PyLadies Vancouver, we welcome people who have never programmed before,
experienced programmers, and everyone in between. We welcome all women,
inclusive of trans women. Further we would like to extend a special invitation
to nonbinary folks, as many (but not all) of the oppressions facing women in our
industry are also experienced by nonbinary individuals. Persons with any gender
identity are welcome to attend our meetups, but should respect that PyLadies
Vancouver is a place where women's voices are centered.
