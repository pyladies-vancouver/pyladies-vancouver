Sponsoring
==========

Thank you for your interest in sponsoring and hosting Vancouver PyLadies.
We several formats: talk nights, workshop, and code jams. Checkout the :ref:`formats <formats>` page
for more details.

For code jam or workshop, everyone will be using their own laptop, so a venue
with tables or a boardroom will work best.

For talk nights, no tables necessary, but enough seating space for up to 30.

For code jams, no projector is necessary. Projector is needed for workshops and talk nights.

For food, we try to budget at least $8 per person. On average, we have 20-30 people show up.

Please fill in the `Hosting Vancouver PyLadies <https://goo.gl/forms/fEWpR1axuhNNs7Dd2>`_ form
to help us plan whether your venue will be suitable for our talk nights, workshop, or code jams.

Everyone attending PyLadies Vancouver are expected to abide by our Code of
Conduct: https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Vancouver/about/

Any questions, please email vancouver@pyladies.com

Thank you to our past and ongoing sponsors!
